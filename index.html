    <p class="text">Hello my full name is Eduardo Jimenez i was born in Oceanside Tri-City hospital, I grew up in Encinitas up until the age of 15 when we moved to Vista, I am the youngest of five with the oldest being 45yrs old. I currently work at fashionPhile but on my days off I am usualy disc golfing or binge watching game of thrones.</p>
    <p>Growing up I enjoyed taking computers apart and learning what makes them tick, I began installing operating systems when I was in 6th grade during my lunch period in the computer lab where I spent most of my time, the first operating system was linux.</p>
